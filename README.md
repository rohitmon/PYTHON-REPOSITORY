# PYTHON-REPOSITORY
In this repository I have written one python program  weather_reader that reads the weather information daily from a website through the json file where the datat is stored in the unstructured format and the common people cannot read the unstructured weather information.It prints it on the mobile screen, digital screen in the railway station,bus stand,colleges,school,airport etc with a text fomat output and this displays the weather information of the entire day as the weathr changes globally with time .
In this repository there is also another python program regarding a puzzle game constructed using the pygame module and the game is animated and it is a slide puzzle game.
Here I have implemented an image classifier in python, which can identify wheteher the image given as input is that of a cat and a dog. So basically here the principle of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used which is known as a machine learning algorithm for machines to understand the feature of image with a foresight and remember the features to guess to detect the new image feeded to the machine. The libraries of python that is used are:
1. TFlearn 2. tqdm 3.numpy 4.open-cv 5.os 6.random 7. matplot lib 8.tensorflow.
